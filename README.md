Revealing how spliceosome work with deep learning. Spliceosome is a large module that is extract intron from mRNA transcription. Here, we have designed a deep learning model to reveal how spliceosome work. Additionally, we have tried to apply an explainable AI approaches to find the biological meaning from the trained model using tensorflow, python, published dataset.
